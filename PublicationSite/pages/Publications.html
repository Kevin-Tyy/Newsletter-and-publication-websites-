                            Ancient Egypt was one of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, spanning over 3,000 years from around 3100 BCE to 30 BCE.
        
                            The ancient Egyptians developed a complex system of writing called hieroglyphics. It consisted of pictorial symbols that represented words, sounds, and concepts. Hieroglyphics were inscribed on temples, tombs, and other monumental structures.
                            
                            The pharaohs, who were considered divine rulers, held the highest political and religious authority in ancient Egypt. They were believed to be the intermediaries between the gods and the people.
                            
                            The Great Pyramids of Giza, built during the Old Kingdom period, are some of the most iconic structures of ancient Egypt. The largest pyramid, the Great Pyramid of Khufu, was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.
